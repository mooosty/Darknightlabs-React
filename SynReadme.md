Overview

This project involves a comprehensive application where the data is managed through various React components. The structure of the application is designed to ensure seamless data flow and efficient user interface management. Below is a detailed explanation of the file structure, starting from App.js down to the data context management in Context.js.

File Structure

1. App.js
App.js is the entry point of the application. It sets up the routes and initializes the main component which for now is just Homepage. I did this in case you want to add more Routes later on or hopefully this will help you integrate the Homepage route easier into your own project.


2. Homepage.js
The Homepage.js component is one of the primary views of the application. It is loaded by App.js and acts as a container for various sub-components. It includes the main navigation and background setup.


3. MainContainer.js
MainContainer.js is a central component that holds the routes for the secondary user action bar. This allows for seemless integration of other components and pages. We also house 2 <divs> inside of this component 'ctr' & 'ctr2' these serve as the primary display frame elements. Inside of those is UserBox which displays the user navigation box and SynergiesBox.js.


4. SynergiesBox.js
SynergiesBox.js is a component that serves as a container for the SynTable.js component


5. SynTable.js
SynTable.js is responsible for outputting the inner container of our Table. This includes the following components and their functions:

    a. SynTableSearch.js: Searchbar and headers
    b. SynergyNav.js: Navigation for table 
    c. TableList.js: Rendering the table rows, cells, data, etc

There is also more code inside Syntable.js at the bottom for the footer. I left this code in because it handles the pagination.


6. TableList.js
TableList.js as mentinoed earlier this is an extension of SynTable.js, managing a detailed list view of the table items. It handles the specifics of each row and column within the table.


7. Data Management: Context.js
Context.js is crucial for managing the application's data. It utilizes React's Context API to store and distribute data across various components, reducing the need for frequent server/database requests.


Key Functions in Context.js
### Context Functions

#### Synergies Context

1. **`useSynergies`**: Custom hook to access the synergies context, providing state and actions related to synergies.

2. **`SynergiesProvider`**: Context provider for managing synergies.
   - **State**:
     - `synergies`: Array of synergy objects.
   - **Actions**:
     - `addSynergy(newSynergy)`: Adds a new synergy.
     - `removeSynergy(id)`: Removes a synergy by its ID.
     - `updateSynergy(updatedSynergy)`: Updates an existing synergy.

#### User Context

1. **`useUser`**: Custom hook to access the user context, providing state and actions related to the user.

2. **`UserProvider`**: Context provider for managing user state.
   - **State**:
     - `user`: Object representing the current user, or `null` if not logged in.
   - **Actions**:
     - `login(userData)`: Logs in the user with the provided data.
     - `logout()`: Logs out the user.





Reducing Database Pings
To optimize performance and reduce server/database pings:

Utilize Context: Store data in context to share across components.

Memoization: Use React's useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Efficient Fetching: Fetch data on component mount and update context, minimizing repeated requests.

This file structure and approach ensure a scalable, efficient, and maintainable codebase, promoting a seamless development experience.
